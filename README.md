# # Bacterial(Bac)16S(SixTNS)

Pipeline develop to work with bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene Aaplicons from Next-generation Sequencing to analise operational taxonomic units (OTU) of soil samples.
The pipeline starts from Illumina-sequenced paired-end fastq files that have been split (or “demultiplexed”) by sample and from which the barcodes/adapters have already been removed. The end product is an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) table, a higher-resolution analogue of the traditional OTU table.
